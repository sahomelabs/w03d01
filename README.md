Week 4 - Day 1 - HW
Practice What You Learned
Creating Classes & Factories
Create a JavaScriptREPLfrom repl.it -- you can name it "JavaScript Classes Lab 3".`

Complete all work in your REPL.it
Then Submit The Link To Your REPL.it in Canvas
Classes Methods and Properties
Hard Mode (Practice Command Line, recall Git )
mkdir in your software_homework/unit_1folder you made on saturday called w03d01
cd into that folder and run the command git init
touch a file called homework.js
open the file up in vs code
do your homework in this file
run your code periodically when you want by opening the terminal/hyper/vscode terminal and running node ~/software_homework/unit_1/w03d01/homework.jsthis assumes you followed all commands correctly
if for some reason you have an issue and you cannot do this successfully it's fine you made a mistake somewhere, you can get help at office hours, just submit your hw with repl.it, this is just a bonus, we'll be practicing this workflow in class during the upcoming weeks.
Follow the prompts to commit your work with git add -A&& git commit -m "Message Here"
When you are done with your hw, make an empty repository on github.comor github.comand then go through the steps to push your local git repository.
Remember again this a bonus
Your link to your github is what you submit
If at any point you get stuck and can't get unstuck, copy and paste your code to repl.it and submit that.
Git issues is not an acceptable reason to not turn in this assignment, the git work is a bonus.
Note
There is a prompt below each section, for Hard Mode it will tell you to save, and commit your work for Easy Mode it will tell you to save and run your code in repl.it.

Create a Story with your Person class
Feel free to update or add methods to automate some of these tasks.

Instantiate a new Person named Timmy
Age Timmy five years
At this point Timmy's a little bummed. As a precocious child, he feels he's "seen it all" already. Have him eat five times.
Now Timmy's a little heavier than he wants to be. Kindergarten's coming up and he wants to look good. Have him exercise five times
Age Timmy 9 years
Create a hamster named "Gus"
Set Gus's owner to the string "Timmy"
Have Timmy "buy" Gus
Age Timmy 15 years
Have Timmy eat twice
Have Timmy exercise twice

Chef Make Dinners
class Dinner {

}

class Chef {

Have the Chef create 3 dinners, log the dinners
